        <p>
            The culture of the USA is primarily of Western, and European origin. 
            <br>
            Its influences include the cultures of Asian American, African American, 
            <br> Latin American and Native American peoples. 
        <br>
            Numerous things that are common in America, have spread all over the world and many people
            <br> don’t know that they have their origin in America. 
            <br>
            American culture is highly unique, which is showing in many ways. 
            <br>Here is a list of American things, that may or may not be unique in America:
        </p>
        <h2>
            Think BIG
        </h2>
        <p>
            Whereas other countries often prefer small and compact, Americans mostly prefer large and luxurious. 
            To them large can be practical. 
            Thinking big not only applies to cars but also to American food. 
            Most restaurants serve very large portions.
        </p>
        <h2>
            "To-go" concept
        </h2>
        <p>
            Most Americans are always on the go. 
            It seem that they’re always in stress and mostly just don’t have enough time. 
            They often don’t have a formal, sit-down meal. 
            Most Americans walk around with coffee mugs, beverages or food packaged in to-go containers. 
            Almost every fast food restaurant has a drive-through window. 
            This trend has spread over the world and many countries are more “To-go”.
        </p>
        <h2>
            Small Talk
        </h2>
        <p>
            A lot of Americans participate in “small talk”. 
            That’s when you make conversations with strangers or acquaintances about non-controversial topics, such as weather, sports or popular television shows. 
            You mostly start “small talk” while waiting in a line, at a bus stop or when you’re in an elevator.
