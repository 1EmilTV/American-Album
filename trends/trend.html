            Republican McCarthy fails again despite Trump's call for elections
        </h4>
        <p class="p1">
        Democratic Kevin McCarthy has failed for the fifth time in his election
        <br> as Speaker of the House of Representatives. 
        <br>
        This redounded from the result of the oral vote on Wednesday, which still had to
        <br> be formally verified by the head of the session in the administrative chamber. 
        <br> <br>
        McCarthy had formerly failed to gain the needed number of votes in former choices 
        <br>because various party associates refused to support him.
        <br>
        Former US President Donald Trump had preliminarily called on all Republicans in the House of 
        Representatives in Washington to handpick Kevin McCarthy as the new president
        <br>of the Congress Chamber.
        <br><br> 
        Trump launched the appeal on Wednesday on his online network Truth Social after
        <br> McCarthy failed to gain the needed simple maturity in three rounds of 
        choices the day
        <br> before.
        <br><br> Indeed though the conservative Republicans hold the maturity in the recently constituted House of Representatives. 
        A number of far-right Trump sympathizers in the Democratic body have refused to support McCarthy because they see him as too moderate.

        US court overturns abortion ban: judges argue with right to privacy
        </h4>
        <p class="p1">
        The Supreme Court in the conservative US state of South Carolina has capsized a law that banned revocations after the sixth week of gestation. 
        The court cited the right to sequestration
        <br> elevated in the state constitution,"which includes a woman's decision to have an revocation", 
        <br> as defense. 
        It's the first time a US court has defended revocation rights since the US Supreme Court capsized the introductory right to revocation in the US since 1973 in June last time.
